## Introduction

In this assignment, we implement a simplified version of the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP) over UDP, a communication protocol used for electronic mail transmission. Unlike the traditional use of TCP for SMTP, this project explores the challenges and considerations of implementing SMTP over UDP.

This project aims to provide a basic understanding of how SMTP functionality can be adapted to work over UDP, including the design choices, packet structure, and error handling mechanisms.


## Usage

To use this project, you can:

1. Explore the source code to understand the implementation details.
2. Run the SMTP server & client implementation.
3. Experiment with sending emails using UDP packets.
4. Test various scenarios and observe the behavior of the SMTP protocol over UDP.
